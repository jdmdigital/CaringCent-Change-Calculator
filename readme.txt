Custom plugin creates the <code>[changecalculator]</code> shortcode for displaying the CaringCent Change Calculator.

== Description ==
Sometimes seeing is believing.  This standalone plugin as built to display the CaringCent Change Calculator in posts or pages.  Global settings can be set from the plugin's settings page at Settings >> Change Calc.  All these settings can be overridden using shortcode attributes.

We created a quick and dirty demo using the default WordPress theme here: http://bootplate.jdmdigital.co/fab-demo/change-calculator-demo/  It's not the prettiest, but you'll get the idea.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin directory to /wp-content/plugins/
2. Go to Plugins from the admin
3. Activate the plugin
4. Go to Settings >> Change Calc to set global settings (or leave default)
5. Place the shortcode, <code>[changecalculator]</code> wherever. 
6. Update the page or post where you want the calculator displayed.
